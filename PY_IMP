Data Types
Text Type : 	str
Numeric Types : 	int, float, complex 
Sequence Types : 	list, tuple
Mapping Type : 	dict
Set Types : 	set, 
Boolean Type : 	bool 
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z =1+9j   # complex

Type Conversion
x = float(1)  print(x)  print(type(x))  Output:<float>

Implicit Type Conversion in Python
a=7
print(type(a))
b=3.0
print(type(b))
c=a+b
print(c)
print(type(c))
# Python automatically converts 
# d to float as it is a float multiplication

Explicit Type Conversion in Python
a=5
# typecast to float
n=float(a)
print(n)
print(type(n))

String in python 
'hello' is the same as "hello".
Example
print("Hello")
print('Hello')

Multiline Strings
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consecteturadipiscingelit,

utlabore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)

String Length
a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))

Check String
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)
output
True

Check if NOT
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("expensive" not in txt)
True

Slicing
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])
output
llo

Slice From the Start
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])
output
Hello

Slice To the End
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])
output
llo, World!

Negative Indexing
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])
