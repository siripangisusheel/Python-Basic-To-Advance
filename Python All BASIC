WHAT IS PYTHON?  
Python is now one of the most popular and widely used programming, Besides web and software development  .It is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language.

Comments In Python
Types:  
1. Single line comment --- represent with special symbol - # (#)
Shortcut Key for comment in programming language is (ctrl+forward Arrow)
2. Multi line comments --- represent with invited quotes with three times-  
‘‘‘you have to write comments with in this quotes ’’’

Variables in python and its use cases
Syntax: Var_name = Value  
Ex: Name = “Suresh” - Str 
Age = 25 - int 
Height = 5.7 - Float

{Examples Are Below}!
Many Values to Multiple Variables 
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry" 
print(x) 
print(y) 
print(z) 

One Value to Multiple Variables 
x = y = z = "Orange" 
print(x) 
print(y) 
print(z) 

Print is a function to print the variable as below
Output Variables 
The Python print() function is often used to output variables. 
x = "Python is awesome" 
print(x)
Output:Python is awesome

In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma: 
Example 
x = "Python" 
y = "is" 
z = "awesome" 
print(x, y, z)
Output:Python is awesome

Built-in Data Types
Text Type :str 
Numeric Types :int, float, complex  
Sequence Types :list, tuple 
Mapping Type :dict 
Set Types :set
Boolean Type :bool  

{Examples Are Below}!
Type is a function to print the Type of X as below
Int: Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length. 
Print the data type of the variable x: 
x = 5 
print(type(x))
Output:<class 'int'> 

Float:Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
Example
x = 1.10, z = -35.59 
print(type(x)) 
print(type(z))

Complex: Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part: 
Example 
x = 3+5j, z = -5j 
print(type(x)) 
print(type(z)) 

Type Conversion 
You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:
Example 
#convert from int to float: 
x = float(1) 
#convert from float to int: 
y = int(2.8) 
#convert from int to complex: 
z = complex(1) 
print(x) 
print(y) 
print(z)
 
print(type(x)) 
print(type(y)) 
print(type(z)) 

Casting 
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting. 
Example 
x = str(3) 
y = int(3) 
z = float(3) 
print(x) 
print(y) 
print(z)
